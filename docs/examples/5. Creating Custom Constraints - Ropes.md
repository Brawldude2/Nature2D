# Creating Custom Constraints - Ropes

In this example, we create custom constraints, mainly a RigidBody hanging on a rope firmly. We'll also simulate the RigidBody by applying wind forces to it. The final result will look like the following:

![rope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74130881/138543444-6978a691-4436-4c48-847a-44b3a44a6e3a.gif)

Firstly, we require the module and initialize the engine. It is important to set a frame for the canvas if we wish to render constraints on screen.

```lua
local canvas = path.to.canvasFrame
local Nature2D = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Nature2D.Engine)

local viewport = workspace.CurrentCamera.ViewportSize

local Engine = Nature2D.init(path.to.screengui)
Engine:SetPhysicalProperty("CollisionMultiplier", 0.1)
Engine:CreateCanvas(Vector2.new(0, 0), viewport, canvas)
```

Next, we choose an anchor point, this is the point the rope hangs on from.

```lua
local Anchor = Engine:CreatePoint(Vector2.new(viewport.X/2, 0), false) -- visible: false
Anchor:KeepInCanvas(false)
Anchor:Snap(true) -- prevent the point from changing positions
```

We then create a RigidBody and connect the anchor and the RigidBody with a constraint.

```lua
local RigidBodyFrame = path.to.UIElement
local Body = Engine:CreateRigidBody(RigidBodyFrame, true, false) -- anchored: false

local TopLeftCorner = Body:GetVertices()[1]
local Rope = Engine:CreateConstraint(Anchor, TopLeftCorner, true, 3) -- visible: true, thickness: 3
Rope:Stroke(Color3.new(1, 1, 1)) -- set constraint color to white
```

We now apply random wind forces to the RigidBody to complete the simulation!

```lua
Engine:Start() -- start the simulation

while task.wait() do
   local random = Random.new()
   Body:ApplyForce(Vector2.new(random:NextNumber(0, 0.5), 0)) -- apply a random wind force
end
```

There you go! You now have a simulation with custom constraints. These constraints can also be used to connect multiple RigidBodies with each other as well as to create custom RigidBodies and SoftBodies!
