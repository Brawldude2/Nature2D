Nature2D is a vast 2D physics library designed for and on [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/)! Ever wanted to create 2D games but step back because Roblox doesn't have a built-in 2D physics engine? Use Nature2D to create versatile and smooth simulations and mechanics for your 2D games with minimum effort! Nature2D primarily uses methods of [Verlet Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) and [Convex Hull collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem)!
