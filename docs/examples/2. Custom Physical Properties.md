# Custom Physical Properties

You can easily set universal physical properties which will be adhered by every RigidBody and Constraint! There is no official API for configuring custom physical properties for individual constraints or rigidbodies as of now, but will be added in the future!

In order to set universal physical properties, use the `Engine:SetPhysicalProperty()` method!

This method takes in 2 parameters - The property name, which is a string and its new value. Here are the physical properties you can set as of now:

* Gravity - Vector2 (By default `Vector2.new(0, 0.3)`)
* Friction - number (By default `0.99`)
* CollisionMultiplier - number (By default `0.8`)

Gravity is a vector, the force is applied every RenderStepped on all rigid bodies. You can simulate 0 gravity or even sideways gravitational force! An example from the previous tutorial:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Nature2D = require(ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("Nature2D").Engine)

local ScreenGui = script.Parent
local Canvas = ScreenGui.Canvas

local engine = Nature2D.init(ScreenGui)

for _, box in ipairs(Canvas.Boxes:GetChildren()) do
	engine:CreateRigidBody(box, true, false) -- [[collidable: true, anchored: false]]
end

engine:SetPhysicalProperty("Gravity", Vector2.new(.2, 0)) -- sideways
engine:Start()
```

Custom friction damping value can also be set to increase or decrease friction. The lower the value of friction, the higher it is!

```lua
engine:SetPhysicalProperty("Friction", 0.9)
```

CollisionMultiplier is a multiplier value used to increase or decrease the repulsion force when a RigidBody collides with the **boundaries of the canvas**. 

```lua
engine:SetPhysicalProperty("CollisionMultiplier", 0.1)
```
